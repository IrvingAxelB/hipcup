There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  Hipcup

## Sub-Heading ##
  For those who want more than just a cup of coffee.

## Summary ##
  Hipcup uses your location to find the nearest cups of coffee near you. Rather than relying on your typical chains, Hipcup promises to serve you a list of hip cafes where you can taste **real** coffee, as well as a map to get there.

## Problem ##
  Many people want to get out for a cup of coffee, but don't want to go to a national chain like Starbucks or Peet's. Chains are noisy, crowded, and don't even provide the best cup of coffe. This app shows you where to get a **real** cup of coffee.

## Solution ##
  Hipcup curates a list of nearby 'hip' shops that give you more than just a $2 cup of coffee by filtering out all the chains nearby using your location.

## Quote from You ##
  "Life isn't only about where you've been. It's about where you've been and where you're going. So go to a cool coffee shop" - Carl Bernardo

## How to Get Started ##
  I love coffee, and I think people should try coffee outside of national chains. Most people revert to get a standard cup of coffee at a chain because they don't know where to go. I wanted to create an app that recommends non-chain places in the click of a button.

## Customer Quote ##
  "I no longer wait 10 minutes in a Starbucks drive-through every morning and instead hop on Hipcup to see what other coffee shops are nearby, and it's been an experience. I feel sorry for my wallet."
